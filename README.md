# Data-Structures-Student-Roster-with-Binary-Search-Tree

This project is built on top of previous project (Data Structures Student Roster)   
* Class size is increased to 20   
* The initial linked structure is modified to be a binary search tree instead    
* A waiting list for classes is added  

Once registration is completed the BST will be saved again as a sorted array, and the final roster will be saved as a text file.
